# README
This project was to create a webapp that simulates the new Animal Crossing game's flower breeding mechanics.

I started this project as a vehicle for me to practice Javascript, JQuery, etc. However, after I got to the point it is currently frozen at, I realized that more effort would be put into getting the mechanics of breeding down than into praciticing/learning.

I want to put this code into some usable form, so I've reused the code for this: https://github.com/ChanFDavis/Conway-GOL-Javascript

### Possible Ideas:
* Enable selection of entire rows or entire columns
* Saving/Loading from a file
* Saving current field state when updating the size
